This project is a C++based Operating System Simulation System, developed inside a Linux environment using VMware. It delivers a simplified yet practical demonstration of how core OS functionalities work, featuring both Kernel Mode and User Mode logic, a graphical interface, and live app execution, all built from scratch.
